In the ordinary case, Jackson\n     * calls this method when it has encountered an OBJECT_START,\n     * and the method implementation must advance to the next token to\n     * see the first field name. If the application configures\n     * polymorphism via a field, then the object looks like the following.\n     *  <pre>\n     *      {\n     *          \"@class\": \"class name\",\n     *          ...\n     *      }\n     *  </pre>\n     *  Jackson consumes the two tokens (the <tt>@class</tt> field name\n     *  and its value) in order to learn the class and select the deserializer.\n     *  Thus, the stream is pointing to the FIELD_NAME for the first field\n     *  after the @class.
