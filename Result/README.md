# 📊 Experimental Results

This directory contains the detailed experimental data, logs, and artifacts generated during the evaluation of **DynaFix**. The results are organized by Research Questions (RQs) as presented in the paper.

## 📂 Directory Contents

* **`Baseline/`**
    * Contains the raw output logs and patches generated by the baseline methods (e.g., ReInFix, AlphaRepair, ChatRepair) used for comparison in our study.

* **`RQ1/` (Effectiveness)**
    * Data for **RQ1**.
    * Includes repair results on **Defects4J v1.2 & v2.0**.
    * Covers experiments under both **perfect** and **imperfect** (GZoltar+Ochiai) fault localization settings.

* **`RQ2/` (Generalization & Robustness)**
    * Data for **RQ2**.
    * **Generalization:** Results on the **Real-World Benchmark (RWB)** across different LLM backends.
    * **Robustness:** Results on the **Defects4J-Trans** (code perturbation) benchmark to evaluate resistance to syntactic changes.

* **`RQ3/` (Efficiency & Cost)**
    * Data for **RQ3**.
    * **Parameter Analysis:** Impact of Search Breadth ($B$) and Depth ($D$) on repair performance.
    * **Cost:** Token consumption statistics and runtime overhead analysis of the instrumentation.

* **`RQ4/` (Qualitative Analysis)**
    * Data for **RQ4**.
    * Includes case studies, unique patch examples, and root cause analysis (e.g., similarity distribution shifts in RAG modules).
